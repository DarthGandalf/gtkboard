movegen: returns a (malloced) movlist: list of moves followed by -2
	where move is a list of triples followed by a -1

implemented a simple minimax; no obvious improvement observed
	by increasing #levels

wrote a decent heuristic which takes into account:
	#of fours
	#no of extendable triples, pairs, singletons
	share of the central columns

TODO: change the other games (chess and othello) to move the arrays
	to the .c file and also to write the init function

TODO: input moves via gtk interface
	DO DFID based on minimax

implemented {human,machine} vs {human,machine}
minimax dfid done
machine can beat me at plot4 :-)))
game_getmove interface to translate clicks into moves
Prof wants us to do chess :-)))

TODO
expand the cbgf file format as well as protocol
implement stuff like taking a move back using the protocol
impl of human/machine is terribly cluttered; clean it up
do more gtk stuff including statusbar and options
Think about how to run tournament
Worry about the shit called solaris
Perfect the plot4 heuristic
Start on movegen and eval for chess

Tried to implement child signalling parent if it finished before
its time was up, got into IPC hell and gave it up. Tried to solve
it by threading the parent, remembered Knuth, (premature opt...)
and dd'd the thread stuff too.
Implemented single player :-)
Samegame working now.
Frills like animation and score calculation missing.
This is more due to the need to carefully define the interface
rather than any difficulty in implementation
I already messed up the setinitpos interface, need to set it 
straight.
Also clean up the namespace. Will help in cleaning up the interface.

TODO
Implement GTK configuration ASAP. This is not for lusers' sake but
to enforce the maxmium possible generality.
Realized the need to separate the tournament (peer?) and 
analysis (helper?) protocols. Start implementing them.
Now that DFID minimax is working fine, finish othello. Maybe checkers?
Note: Lots of interfaces waiting to be defined

The light struck me and I realized that I need have only one child
process and not 2. Thus I MAJORLY cleaned up the code. Lots of things
become much simpler now. 
Implemented the protocol partly. There is really no need to have 2
different protocols. In the current impl, partitioning bet player
and gtk is much more strict.
Its looking like it will be difficult to choose the game after forking
the child. An acceptable compromise.
Partitioning of functions bet gtk and player yet to be finalized

TODO:
Lots of things, but the most imp is GUI config.

Basic GUI working. Code more general but more complications introduced.
Planning to implement move stack.

Did movegen for chess/antichess
(Doesn't have castling/promotion/en passant)
Fixed some bugs in gui and improved player
BUG: changing the game doesn't decrease the size of the window
even if it needs to

Added hash
Did getmove for ataxx

ver 0.7

cleaned up the code (mainly move.c)
implemented movstack (back and forw)
seems to be working decently
major decision ahead: do we support stateful games
implemented reset game; realized that changing the 
player and game is really screwed up. Got to clean
this up
This thing's become big enough to warrant a separate
BUGS/TODO :-)

ver 0.7.1
wrote movegen/eval for ataxx; machine can easily beat me
next: othello, antichess; after that alpha-beta
TODO: share pixmaps between games

ver 0.7.2

Minor UI improvements and bug fixes

wrote movegen and eval for othello.
Doesn't work well with minimax, suffers from
high bf and horizon effect

Restarted after a long time :-)
Implemented ab (with hashing for same depth)
Wrote movegen for antichess (and completed getmove)
Wrote who_won for hiq

Sun Sep 15 23:46:39 IST 2002
Implemented antialiased balls.
Looks much better than the raw ones, but can be improved
Fixed bug in antichess_movegen where a promoted pawn stays
a pawn

Lots of new stuff
Support for animation in the engine; 5 new games
Support for RGB instead of pixmaps. This is crucial
for many games. Makes AAAB a lot easier
Feature freeze now :)))))
Make the front end code a LOT cleaner before going further.
Future plans:
New games:
  * Memory
  * Go
  * Mancala (Awari...)
  * Sticks

Support for
  * single player search
  * not using movstack
  * independent widgets
  * STATEFUL!!!

Code size crosses 7000 lines :)
In the meanwhile the tournament was conducted

Fixed some bugs including divide by 0 in aaball.c
Games can choose not to have movstack for animations
Multiple full lines now vanish together in tetris
Cleaned up some interfaces where memory was not getting freed
Ghosts pseudo-working in pacman (need stateful to work properly)
Cleaned up front end somewhat
Fixed back end bug where movstack wasn't trunc()ed - this was
a schroedinbug :)
Just a little more of testing, fixing and cleaning of the front
end before implementing stateful. And then its 1.0 Nirvana :)
Much improved ghosts for pacman
